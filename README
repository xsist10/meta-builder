The Meta Builder Library is a simple library to construct
and render forms using an abstracted meta description of the
form.

This is useful for rapid development of interfaces that will
work consistently and provide enough flexibility to not
require special cases which often plague form builders.

This library has seperated the code into 4 major sections:

1. Builder Classes
-----
This code is used to generate valid DOM based on the meta
data description it is provided with.

2. Build Helper Classes
-----
This can be used to generate the meta data by creating
objects, assigning them attributes and adding them to valid
parent objects.

3. Javascript Libraries
-----
All the javascript is seperated from the meta data and is
attached after rendering using jQuery.

4. CSS
-----
There is no styling in the generated DOM elements. Rather,
the DOM created tends to be verbose with regards to classes
and many custom stylings can be set using these classes. If
these are not enough, you can add custom classes almost
anywhere in the meta data.
